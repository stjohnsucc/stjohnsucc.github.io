We are proud to host a Special Needs Dance. These dances were born from Linda Miller's desire to have a place for her disabled to son to feel safe, welcome, and have a great time. Bring your friends and family to enjoy great music and delicious cookies!

Dances are held on the last Saturday of the month, 7pm-9pm.
