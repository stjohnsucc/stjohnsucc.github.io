St. Johnâ€™s reaches out to the community to help our neighbors who have eviction notices and utility shut-off notices.

We maintain a fund that can provide up to $50 toward utility shut-offs or $100 toward evictions. Click the button to apply. Have the following information ready:

* A scan or photo of your photo ID
* A scan or photo of your eviction notice or shut-off notice
* Your name, address, and phone number
* For evictions, the name and address of your landlord
* Any additional information or special circumstances

We typically process requests twice a week, and mail a check directly to your landlord or utility provider within 7 business days. Thank you for your patience and understanding!

The Samaritan Fund also maintains a list of agencies which may offer additional assistance. [Click here to view the list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zXC2cvpoNEdRPcr_gnNdA2aJ8XnAppY_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115308652994350335242&rtpof=true&sd=true)
