The third week of every month is a busy week here at St. Johnâ€™s! Our food pantry serves over 100 individuals and families monthly.

We provide food, personal care items, and gently-used clothing. The food pantry is open from 10am to 12pm on the third Friday of every month. If you want to participate, we welcome volunteers for set-up, serving, and clean-up, and we can always use donations! Non-perishable foods and personal care items are always needed.

Please bring your photo ID; many of our donors require that we keep records.
