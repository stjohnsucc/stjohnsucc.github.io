## We are accepting applications for our Literacy Coaching program!

### Scholarships are available

The "NHL@SJUCC" is an outreach program that offers literacy coaching for students ages 5-12. Our purpose is to support students by increasing their confidence in reading which we believe will improve their academic success. The initiative was founded by the Hackworth family in 2022.

#### Endorsements

> With the strategies and practices that the program has implemented along with the one on one instruction, I have not only seen an increased ability with phonetics, fluency, and in comprehension, but, maybe most importantly, I have also seen a huge increase in DJ's confidence. He is excited for group reading and enjoys teaching others about the reading strategies that he has developed. </br> &mdash; Elementary Teacher Alivia Demeuse
