We are thrilled to announce that we will be merging with Westminster Presbyterian Church this July! We are looking forward to welcoming their members as new members of our church family.

We will be welcoming Jon Kreuger into our office staff. Jon's sunny presence in our office means we will be able to expand our office hours (we're hoping to be open 9-5 every weekday) and reach even more people with our outreach programs, especially providing emergency food and showers and helping people apply for the Samaritan Fund. Jon also brings a wealth of experience in music leadership, and has some great ideas on how to make our worship experience more accessible, especially for anyone tuning in remotely.

Westminster is joining us after parting ways with their longtime spiritual leader, Pastor Karen, whom we hope will enjoy her hard-earned retirement. To help guide them through this difficult transition, they are bringing in Pastor Jake as their Interim Pastor. Pastors Jake and Judy will be sharing the pulpit, delivering messages on alternate Sundays. Researching and preparing a sermon takes dozens of hours each week, so hopefully this distribution of labor will enable both part-time ministers to devote more time to more intimate forms of Pastoral Care.

This is going to be a difficult transition for everyone, but we will come out of it better and stronger than ever! We are so blessed to be able to share our space with Westminster, and the love and passion they bring will revolutionize our worship and outreach. As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.
