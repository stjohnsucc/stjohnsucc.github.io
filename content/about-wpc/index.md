description: Welcome to Westminster Presbyterian Church!

Westminster is a Church: a gathering of people who journey together in faith out of our shared trust in Jesus Christ. We are at various stages on that faith journey. We come together for worship, and go out to serve. Along the way, we also enjoy eating and have some fun together!

We really do welcome everyone! "God’s grace has openly welcomed us to the love and redemption that are ours through Jesus Christ. Reflecting the love that Jesus Christ offers to all, Westminster Presbyterian Church welcomes every person to participate in all aspects of our church community regardless of sexual orientation, color, gender identity, religious background, social or economic class, ethnicity, nationality, or ability. We consciously strive to create an environment of mutual respect, hospitality and warmth in which none are strangers and all may flourish as we seek to love and serve God and neighbor in our worship and ministries together."

Westminster is a congregation of the Presbyterian Church USA (PCUSA). What Do Presbyterians Stand For?
